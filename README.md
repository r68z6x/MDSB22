Introduce Yourself! What’s your name? a. On one side of the paper, write what the professor and the other students should call you

during class discussions. If you want, you can include what pronouns we should use for

you. b. On the other side of the paper, let us know how to say your name. Please write it out

syllable-by-syllable and in a way that would help people pronounce it (e.g., include

rhyming words, images, IPA)

Example:

i. s + air + uh

2 syllables. Bold indicates which syllable is stressed. “s” = hissing sound; “air” rhymes with stair and bear; “uh” is the sound you make when you don’t know

something ii. ?s??? iii. In my email signature I also have a link to a recording of me pronouncing my name Introduce Yourself! Introduce yourself to each other in pairs or small groups by responding to the

(i.e., social media posts, film, television, radio, music, comics, articles,

concerts, etc.).

a. In pairs/groups, write out any that were particularly memorable (and that you feel

comfortable sharing) b. Do you think any could count as feminist media? Identify one thing and say where

and how you encountered it, and then discuss why you think it does or doesn’t count
